                        <h3>Childhood in Quezon City</h3>
                        <p>
                            My name is Miko Antonio S. Racho, and my childhood played a huge role in shaping the person I am today.
                            I grew up in Quezon City, a place full of noise, movement, and energy.
                            Living in the city taught me how to adapt to a fast-paced environment.
                            Despite the busy surroundings, I always found joy in simple things.
                            One of the biggest parts of my childhood was playing basketball.
                            Basketball became more than just a game for me.
                            Whether in Quezon City or Bulacan, it taught me patience, teamwork, and respect.

                        <p>
                            My teenage years were a time of growth, discovery, and strong friendships.
                            Friends became very important to me during this stage.
                            We spent time together after school, talked about our dreams, and supported one another.
                            Basketball remained part of my life and helped strengthen our bond.
                            These years taught me confidence, communication, loyalty, and trust.

                        <h3>College Life</h3>
                        <p>
                            My college life marks a new and important chapter in my journey.
                            It introduced me to a more challenging academic environment.
                            I learned how to manage my time, work with others, and become more independent.
                            Despite challenges and pressure, college continues to help me grow.
                            I believe these experiences are preparing me for the real world.
