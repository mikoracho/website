                    <h3>Titanic</h3>
                    <p class="movie-desc">Titanic is a sweeping historical epic that uses the real-life 1912 tragedy as a backdrop for a "star-crossed lovers" narrative. The film centers on Rose DeWitt Bukater, a young woman suffocating under the weight of her aristocratic family’s expectations and an impending loveless marriage. Her life changes when she meets Jack Dawson, a free-spirited artist from the "steerage" class who wins his ticket in a poker game. Their whirlwind romance serves as a critique of the rigid class structures of the Edwardian era, showing how Jack's philosophy of "making each day count" mirrors the Carpe Diem spirit found in Dead Poets Society.</p>

                    <h3>Dead Poets Society</h3>
                    <p class="movie-desc">Dead Poets Society is a poignant exploration of individuality set within the rigid, stifling walls of a 1950s elite prep school. It follows a group of students whose lives are forever changed by their unconventional English teacher, John Keating. By teaching them the philosophy of Carpe Diem (Seize the Day), Keating encourages them to look at poetry and life through their own eyes rather than the dusty lenses of tradition. The film is a beautiful, though eventually tragic, tribute to the power of artistic expression and the rebellion required to find one's own voice in a world that demands conformity.</p>

                    <h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
                    <p class="movie-desc">Good Will Hunting shifts the setting to the rough streets of South Boston, focusing on a 20-year-old janitor at MIT who happens to be a mathematical genius. Unlike the students in Dead Poets Society who are searching for a spark, Will Hunting already has the "fire"—he just uses it as a shield to keep the world at a distance. When he is forced into therapy to avoid jail time, he meets Sean Maguire, a soulful therapist who challenges Will to stop hiding behind his intellect and face his past trauma. It is a raw, deeply moving story about the courage it takes to be vulnerable and the realization that being "smart" isn't the same thing as being "whole."</p>
